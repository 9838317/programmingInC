This is a non blocking example of server using process.


compile ./1client/5b_clientGetFile.c to get the client.

      gcc 5b_clientGetFile.c -ll2net -llas -o client;

then run with 8888 port to connect the server.

    ./client 8888

    server:
    
      compile 6b_testForkServer.c or 6c_sendFileServerNonBlocking to get the server.
      
              gcc 6b_testForkServer.c -ll2net -llas -o server;
              gcc 6c_sendFileServerNonBlocking.c -ll2net -llas -o server;
              
      then run with 8888 port to serve. 
      
          ./server 8888
          
          
make sure the txt file is big enough to see the blocking, better more than 200m.
