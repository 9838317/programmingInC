This is a blocking example of server.

    client:
    
      compile ./1client/5b_clientGetFile.c to get the client.

	    gcc 5b_clientGetFile.c -ll2net -llas -o client;

      then run with 8888 port to connect the server.

	  ./client 8888
 
    server:
    
      compile 6b_sendFileServer.c to get the server.
      
              gcc 6b_sendFileServer.c -ll2net -llas -o server;
              
      then run with 8888 port to serve. 
      
          ./server 8888
          
          
make sure the txt file is big enough to see the blocking, better more than 200m.
